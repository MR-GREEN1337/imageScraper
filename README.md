# imageScraper
scrape images from the internet!

it takes two in-command inputs: number of wanted images for each search engine(Bing, Baidu and Google), and query(what you want to searh for).
You need to install the following packages:
    pip install os
    pip install icrawler
    pip install requests
    pip install os
